    Happy Birthday, Mami. I love you very much and am so grateful to have you. To be honest, I don't know exactly how old you are. I can do the math, but I like to think you're 30 because it doesn't conflict with reality. I know that I don't call much, but that doesn't mean I don't think about you and the family often. I couldn't be me without you, and having you as a mother is truly a blessing. Have a great day :)</p>

    Good mourning, Sun. 
    <br>
    Today is born. 
    <br>
    So, cry and be free of yesterday’s grief.
    <br>
    From what I see, the light you lovingly breathe livens all things.
    <br>
    So, look at all of your creations. Love the Eden you have built.
    <br>
    Don’t fear the bees who love the garden and only love the Monarchs who do not sting. 
    <br>
    They wanna sing and also animate all your beautiful things.
    <br>
    Your flowers dance with the breeze of summer’s 80’s beats, just like in their jovial spring
    <br>
    From when your garden sprung, and they’ll dance until their autumn comes. 
    <br>
    Today for me, it’s barely dawn. But I feel the rise of Summer’s son. 
    <br>
    I feel grace coursing through my roots. 
    <br>
    I see because my nature promulgates truth.
    <br>
    A perfect view of me is incomplete without you.
    <br>
    Yet, perfection is a duel that may never be won.
    <br>
    Still, I’ll follow your lead until my winter’s begun. 
    <br>
    Remember and never forget.
    <br>
    I am a Marigold, and you are my Sun.
